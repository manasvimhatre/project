        <p>Diffie-Hellman key exchange is a cryptographic protocol that allows two parties that have no prior knowledge of each other to jointly establish a shared secret key over an insecure communications channel. This key can then be used to encrypt subsequent
            communications using a symmetric key cipher. The Diffie–Hellman key exchange algorithm solves the following dilemma. Alice and Bob want to share a secret key for use in a symmetric cipher, but their only means of communication is insecure.
            Every piece of information that they exchange is observed by their adversary Eve. How is it possible for Alice and Bob to share a key without making it available to Eve? At first glance it appears that Alice and Bob face an impossible task.
            It was a brilliant insight of Diffie and Hellman that the difficulty of the discrete logarithm problem for F *p provides a possible solution. The simplest, and original, implementation of the protocol uses the Multiplicative group of integers
            modulo p, where p is prime and g is primitive root mod p. Here is an example of the protocol: 1. Alice and Bob agree to use a prime number p=23 and base g=5. 2. Alice chooses a secret integer Xa=6, then sends Bob (g^XA) mod p. 56 mod 23 =
            8. 3. Bob chooses a secret integer Xb=15, then sends Alice (g^XB) mod p. 515 mod 3 = 19. 4. Alice computes YA = (g^XA) mod p. 196 mod 23 = 2. 5. Bob computes YB = (g^XB) mod p. 815 mod 23 = 2. sendsass="footer">
